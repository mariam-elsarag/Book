# Bookshop

## Overview

This project is a simple book website developed using Node.js. It allows bookshop owners to manage books by adding new entries, while regular users can view the available books. This initial version focuses on practicing Node.js

## Features

- **Display Books:** Users can browse and view the list of books available on the website.
- **Add Books:** Bookshop owners can add new books to the website.
- **Update Books:** Existing books can be modified with updated information.
- **Delete Books:** Book entries can be removed from the list.

## Version 1.0 Details

In this version, all CRUD operations are accessible without permission checks. This approach facilitates learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of Node.js development.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates will include implementing permission controls to restrict book management functionalities to authorized users (i.e., book shop owners). Regular users will continue to have access to view-only capabilities.
