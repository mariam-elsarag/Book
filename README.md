# Bookshop

## Overview

This project is a simple book website developed using Node.js. It allows bookshop owners to manage books by adding new entries, while regular users can view the available books. This initial version focuses on practicing Node.js.

## Main Technology

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **Redux**: A state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React.
- **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nested rules, and more.
- **PrimeReact**: A collection of rich UI components for React.

## Features

- **Display Books**: Users can browse and view the list of books available on the website.
- **Add Books**: Bookshop owners can add new books to the website.
- **Update Books**: Existing books can be modified with updated information.
- **Delete Books**: Book entries can be removed from the list.

## Version 1.0 Details

In this version, all CRUD operations are accessible without permission checks. This approach facilitates learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of Node.js development.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates will include implementing permission controls to restrict book management functionalities to authorized users (i.e., bookshop owners). Regular users will continue to have access to view-only capabilities.
